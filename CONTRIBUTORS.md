## NIST would like to thank the following individuals for their contributions to NEMO

**Ryan Goggin** (@Goggin) from University of Waterloo, for recommending the best practice that Django database migrations be included with NEMO's source code.

**David Barth** (@dsbarth) and **Daniel McNesby** (@przcomp) from Princeton University, for:
* finding and diagnosing a bug in NEMO's LDAP authentication code
* forking NEMO's code base, and implementing improvements that could easily be merged back into the mainline

**Mathieu Rampant** (@mrampant-nist) for billing report integration with NEMO, packaging improvements, and code quality suggestions.

**Lizhong Zhang** (@lizhongz) for containerizing NEMO with Docker.
