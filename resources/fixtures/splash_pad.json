The rapidity of her screw was such that I could neither follow nor count its revolutions. When I reflected that this marvellous electric agent, after having afforded motion, heat, and light to the Nautilus, still protected her from outward attack, and transformed her into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken, my admiration was unbounded, and from the structure it extended to the engineer who had called it into existence.",

The reefs were still numerous, but more equalised, and marked on the chart with extreme precision. The Nautilus easily avoided the breakers of Money to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard, placed at 130° long. and on the 10th parallel, which we strictly followed.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nOn the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and recognised the island of that name in 122° long.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nFrom this point the direction of the Nautilus inclined towards the south-west. Her head was set for the Indian Ocean. Where would the fancy of Captain Nemo carry us next? Would he return to the coast of Asia or would he approach again the shores of Europe? Improbable conjectures both, to a man who fled from inhabited continents. Then would he descend to the south? Was he going to double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and finally go as far as the Antarctic pole? Would he come back at last to the Pacific, where his Nautilus could sail free and independently? Time would show.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nAfter having skirted the sands of Cartier, of Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott, last efforts of the solid against the liquid element, on the 14th of January we lost sight of land altogether. The speed of the Nautilus was considerably abated, and with irregular course she sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters, sometimes floated on their surface.",

Was I free again or a prisoner? Quite free. I opened the door, went to the half-deck, went up the central stairs. The panels, shut the evening before, were open. I went on to the platform.\r\n\r\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:33 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\r\nNed Land and Conseil waited there for me. I questioned them; they knew nothing. Lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally unconscious, they had been astonished at finding themselves in their cabin.\r\n\r\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:33 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\r\nAs for the Nautilus, it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever. It floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace. Nothing seemed changed on board.\r\n\r\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:33 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\r\nThe second lieutenant then came on to the platform, and gave the usual order below.\r\n\r\nAs for Captain Nemo, he did not appear.\r\n\r\nOf the people on board, I only saw the impassive steward, who served me with his usual dumb regularity.\r\n\r\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:33 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\r\nAbout two o'clock, I was in the drawing-room, busied in arranging my notes, when the Captain opened the door and appeared. I bowed. He made a slight inclination in return, without speaking. I resumed my work, hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the events of the preceding night. He made none. I looked at him. He seemed fatigued; his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; his face looked very sorrowful. He walked to and fro, sat down and got up again, took a chance book, put it down, consulted his instruments without taking his habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy.",

Currently troubleshooting\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 4th, 2024 @ 9:11 AM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nThe overtemp relay is faulty causing the temp to stop at 150 degrees when asking for 180 degrees.\r\nA new OT relay has been rush ordered.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 11th, 2024 @ 11:38 AM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nThe new Relay has been installed and the alarm has stopped. However, now the relay contactor will not pull in to apply heat to the heaters. Continuing to troubleshoot control signals and voltages for the failure.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 11th, 2024 @ 2:31 PM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nAfter further testing and troubleshooting it is determined that the Main heating element is bad and will need to be replaced. A call has been made to the vendor for replacement parts.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, February 6th, 2024 @ 1:43 PM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nExpecting the new heating element to arrive this Thursday, 2/8/24.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, February 12th, 2024 @ 2:33 PM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nThe new heater element has arrived. But in our attempts to remove the old heater it is apparent that this must be done by cutting and welding. We will be sending it to the vendor for major reworking of the heater element and its shroud. Package will be shipped to the vendor on tues 2/13/2024\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, February 15th, 2024 @ 2:46 PM Pierre Aronnax (professor) updated this task:\r\nThere was a short delay in shipping. The package is with shipping today.\r\nWe have news from the vendor that this type of repair requires one additional part which is a custom designed specification and the lead time is not until April before they receive the part and begin repairs. \" This repair is waiting on a part that currently has a delivery date of 4/4/24\" (from the vendor).",
